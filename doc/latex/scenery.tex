\chapter{Scenery module}

\kw{scenery} is the module that describes the geometry of the scene.  A sphere, a cube, a mesh, a light ...  It are all \kw{SceneObject}s that reside in this module.  But since transformations and acceleration techniques are treated as special compound objects~\cite{kirk88ray}, here is too where you find them.
